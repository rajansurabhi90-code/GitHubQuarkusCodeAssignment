# Case Study Scenarios to discuss

## Scenario 1: Cost Allocation and Tracking
**Situation**: The company needs to track and allocate costs accurately across different Warehouses and Stores. The costs include labor, inventory, transportation, and overhead expenses.

**Task**: Discuss the challenges in accurately tracking and allocating costs in a fulfillment environment. Think about what are important considerations for this, what are previous experiences that you have you could related to this problem and elaborate some questions and considerations

**Questions you may have and considerations:**
Answers ::
a) In a fulfillment environment, costs come from many places — 
warehouses, stores, transport, labor, and shared services. 
The biggest challenge is that not all costs clearly belong to one place or one order.
 A lot of costs are shared, and that makes it hard to answer simple questions like:
    1. Which warehouse is actually profitable? 
    2. Which store is expensive to fulfill from?
    3. How much does one order really cost us?
b) Key Challenges -
   1. Shared costs are hard to split.
   2. Need to think do we split them evenly or by size or by volume of orders.
   3. Labor cost is usually is the biggest task which can change over time due to sales , or holidays or peak season.
   4. Inventory costs are more than buying a stock. (storage, handling etc)
   5. Transportation costs are more.

## Scenario 2: Cost Optimization Strategies
**Situation**: The company wants to identify and implement cost optimization strategies for its fulfillment operations. The goal is to reduce overall costs without compromising service quality.

**Task**: Discuss potential cost optimization strategies for fulfillment operations and expected outcomes from that. How would you identify, prioritize and implement these strategies?

**Questions you may have and considerations:**
1. Reducing Labour cost since this is the biggest challenge.
    Implementation: 
        a. Reduce overtime by better scheduling.
        b. cross train emplyoee's so they aren't overloaded.
        c. Simplify picking and packing process 
    outcome : 
       a. Better productivity , low labor cost.
       b. less burnouts or errors.
2. Smarter Inventory placement 
     - Store fast moving items closer to customer.
     - Reduce overstock.
     - Avoid unneccessary transfers.
3. Transportation Cost optimization 
     - consolidate shipments.
     - use right service level not everything needs to be express
     - improve packaging to reduce weight and size.

## Scenario 3: Integration with Financial Systems
**Situation**: The Cost Control Tool needs to integrate with existing financial systems to ensure accurate and timely cost data. The integration should support real-time data synchronization and reporting.

**Task**: Discuss the importance of integrating the Cost Control Tool with financial systems. What benefits the company would have from that and how would you ensure seamless integration and data synchronization?

**Questions you may have and considerations:**
1. Accurate cost tracking
   - When the Cost Control Tool shares data directly with the accounting system, all costs—labor, inventory, transport, 
   - overhead—are automatically reflected in financial reports.
   - Reduces manual errors from spreadsheets or manual entry.
2. Real-time visibility
    Managers can see cost trends as they happen.
    Supports faster decisions, e.g., adjusting staffing, shifting inventory, or optimizing transport.
3. Better reporting and forecasting
     Financial systems can combine operational cost data with budgets, revenue, and P&L reports.
     Enables scenario planning and improved forecasting.

## Scenario 4: Budgeting and Forecasting
**Situation**: The company needs to develop budgeting and forecasting capabilities for its fulfillment operations. The goal is to predict future costs and allocate resources effectively.

**Task**: Discuss the importance of budgeting and forecasting in fulfillment operations and what would you take into account designing a system to support accurate budgeting and forecasting?

**Questions you may have and considerations:**
Budgeting and forecasting should take into account of following
1. Historical data availability
     a. How accurate and detailed is our past cost data?
     b. Are labor, inventory, and transport costs captured consistently?
2 Cost drivers
     a. Which factors most affect costs?
     b. How do seasonal peaks or promotions impact labor and transport?
3. Integration 
     a. How frequently the data sync should occur.
4. use friendly interface
5. Compare forecast to actuals regularly.

## Scenario 5: Cost Control in Warehouse Replacement
**Situation**: The company is planning to replace an existing Warehouse with a new one. The new Warehouse will reuse the Business Unit Code of the old Warehouse. The old Warehouse will be archived, but its cost history must be preserved.

**Task**: Discuss the cost control aspects of replacing a Warehouse. Why is it important to preserve cost history and how this relates to keeping the new Warehouse operation within budget?

**Questions you may have and considerations:**
Replacing a warehouse is a big operational change, and cost control is critical. Even though a new warehouse is being opened, the company still needs to understand historical costs to plan, budget, and manage the new operation effectively.
Preserving cost history is important because
1. Historical costs help estimate what the new warehouse is likely to cost.
2. Without historical data the new warehouse may ovespend because you dont know what are normal cost for the bu unit.
3. Helps for audits or reporting.
4. Archiving the old warehouse ensure records are preserved.
Cost Control considerations for the new warehouse 
1. Use historical cost patterns to set realistic budgets , allocate labor, utilities, and transport costs
2. Track new warehouse costs from day one.
3. Since the new warehouse shares the old code, ensure historical data is arhived properly.

Identify areas for cost optimization
